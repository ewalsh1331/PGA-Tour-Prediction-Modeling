# PGA-Tour-Prediction-Modeling

1. Data Imports:
  Import the data from the DataGolf.com API. NOTE: for this file to work, need a datagolf.com subscription. 
  
2. Data Processing and Factor Creation:
  Process the data (clean, EDA, ext.) and then create basic factors for the linear model. Need round data from previous document for this to work.
  
3. Linear Model Creation - Baseline Prediction:
  Modeling processing behind the linear model. Iterative process, saves the base linear model.
  
4. Model Creation - Residuals and Course Fit:
  Use the baseline model to predict for the future - use the residuals to create course fit ideas. Go over how to integrate the course fit idea into the baseline model - also how it can be improved.
